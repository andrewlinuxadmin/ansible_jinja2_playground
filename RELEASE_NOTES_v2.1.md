# Release Notes v2.1.0

## 🚀 Major Features

### 📊 Ansible Compatibility Scanner

- **NEW**: `scan_ansible_filters.py` - Comprehensive Ansible filter and test compatibility scanner
- Automatically discovers all available Ansible filters and tests from installed version
- Tests compatibility with the playground endpoint via HTTP
- Generates detailed compatibility reports in text and JSON formats
- Discovers 100+ filters and tests across 9 Ansible modules
- Achieved 100% success rate on tested filters and tests

### 🧹 Code Organization & Cleanup

- Removed duplicate and unnecessary test files following `.copilotrc` rules
- Consolidated test structure to "1 test file per endpoint"
- Cleaned up temporary result files and outdated configurations
- Improved code organization and maintainability

## 🔧 Improvements

### 🧪 Testing Framework

- Streamlined test structure from 18+ files to 8 focused test files
- Removed duplicate test cases for history duplicate prevention
- Eliminated test files for specific filter testing (replaced by scanner)
- Maintained comprehensive endpoint coverage

### 📁 File Structure

- Removed temporary result files (`filters_test_results.json`, `new_filters_test_results.json`)
- Cleaned up obsolete configuration files (`playbook_match.yml`)
- Removed Python cache directories for cleaner repository
- Preserved essential utilities (`deduplicate_history.py`) as per project rules
